# WaydroidQuectelRIL
Some stuff to get Quectel RIL drivers working in Waydroid with a custom LineageOS build.  
This repository does not contain any binary files!  
The RIL driver files are just empty placeholders to be replaced with the real ones provided directly by Quectel.  
  
Also these files are just supposed to be used as a reference and shouldn't be copy pasted into an android build with the expectation of it working.  
I'm not an android developer nor do I really know why and how all of those files need to be the way they are, so please dont ask me for support.  
Instead please refer to the RIL driver manual provided by Quectel or ask in their support forum.
